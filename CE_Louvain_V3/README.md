In the first level(s), the node traversal will follow the order imposed by the initial random shuffling of nodes. 
After that, the graph is re-ordered and the traversal happens based on the new ordering.

The compile and run instructions are the same as those of the orignial Louvian algorithm. Please refer to readme.txt
